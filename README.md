# Model-Deployed
Initial deployment of classification model of iris dataset
In this tutorial I have followed the instructions of creating a completely separate environment for the project. Then, installed the required libraries and modules. After that, I trained a simple `LogisticRegression` model on the iris dataset and exported the model as a `.joblib` file. Lastly, I used the webpage interface to get dimwnsions from the user and predicted the class using the saved model and directed the user to another webpage for he results.
